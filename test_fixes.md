# Test Plan for React App Fixes

## Issue 1: New Scan Button State Reset

### Problem
After performing a scan and clicking the New Scan button, the URL submission form does not reliably reappear.

### Fix Applied
1. **Dashboard.tsx**: Updated `handleNewScan` to use `clearScanData()` from context instead of manually setting state
2. **ScanContext.tsx**: 
   - Added `useMemo` for `hasScanData` computation for better reliability
   - Enhanced `clearScanData` function with proper logging
   - Improved state management consistency

### Test Steps
1. Run a scan on a repository
2. Verify scan results appear
3. Click "New Scan" button
4. Verify the scan form reappears immediately
5. Verify no residual scan data remains

## Issue 2: AI Fix Button Functionality

### Problem
The AI Fix button inside the vulnerability table does nothing when clicked.

### Fix Applied
1. **VulnerabilityTable.tsx**: 
   - Updated `handleGetAIFix` to properly set vulnerability and open modal
   - Improved AI availability check with better error handling
   - Ensured modal state is properly managed

2. **AIFixModal.tsx**: Already properly implemented to:
   - Call `apiClient.getAIRecommendation()` when modal opens
   - Handle loading states
   - Display errors appropriately
   - Show AI recommendations in a modal

### Test Steps
1. Run a scan to get vulnerabilities
2. Click "AI Fix" button on any vulnerability
3. Verify modal opens with loading state
4. Verify API call is made to `/scan/recommendation`
5. Verify AI recommendation is displayed or error is shown
6. Verify modal can be closed properly

## Code Changes Summary

### Dashboard.tsx
- Added `clearScanData` to context destructuring
- Updated `handleNewScan` to use `clearScanData()` instead of manual state reset
- Added proper logging for debugging

### ScanContext.tsx
- Added `useMemo` import
- Wrapped `hasScanData` computation in `useMemo` for better performance
- Enhanced `clearScanData` with logging
- Improved state management reliability

### VulnerabilityTable.tsx
- Updated `handleGetAIFix` to be async and properly set modal state
- Improved AI availability check with better error handling
- Added comments explaining the flow

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. **New Scan Button**: Should immediately show the scan form when clicked
2. **AI Fix Button**: Should open modal, make API call, and display results
3. **State Management**: Should be consistent and reliable across all components
4. **Error Handling**: Should gracefully handle API failures and network issues

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Start the frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```
